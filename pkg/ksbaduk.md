This small package edits in LaTeX the recordings of baduk. Baduk is a traditional board game of long history in the East Asia, in which two players alternately put black and white stones trying to take possession of the territory on the board.
The ‘ks’ in ksbaduk takes its name from the name of the author. Baduk is the Korean name for this game. Badukpan (goban in Japanese) is the name for the board with 19 by 19 lines on which the game is played. The title of this package originated from these words.
This package utilizes TikZ to draw the baduk diagrams, thus let everyone make a nice printable output from simple and elementary inputs.
